        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Add all the chopped ingredients and cilantro leaves to a food processor or blender.</li>

        <h4>Blend and season:</h4>
        <li>Pulse or blend the ingredients until you get a fairly smooth consistency. You can adjust the texture depending on your preference - some like it chunky, while others prefer it smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the vinegar or lime juice, starting with 2 tablespoons. Blend again to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, and additional vinegar/lime juice if desired. If the mixture feels too thick, add a tablespoon of water at a time until you reach the preferred consistency.</li>
        <li>Transfer the guasacaca to a serving bowl. You can drizzle a little olive oil on top for an extra touch.</li>

        <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
        <li>Serve immediately with your favorite Venezuelan dishes like <a href="arepas.html">arepas</a>, grilled meats, <a href="empanadas.html">empanadas</a> or enjoy it with plantain chips for a delicious snack.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use ripe avocados for the creamiest texture.</li>
        <li>Adjust the amount of vinegar/lime juice according to your desired level of acidity..</li>
        <li>If you don't have a food processor or blender, you can finely mince all the ingredients and mix them together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Guasacaca is best enjoyed fresh, but you can store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a day. However, the color may darken slightly due to avocado oxidation.</li>
    </ul>
