    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>Make the dough:</h4>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine corn flour with salt. Gradually add warm water, mixing with a spoon until a crumbly dough forms.</li>
        <li>If using, add a drizzle of oil for added flakiness.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>

    <h4>Prepare the filling:</h4>
        <li>Follow your chosen filling recipe to cook and prepare the ingredients. Ensure the filling is cool before assembling.</li>


    <h4>Assemble the empanadas:</h4>
        <li>Divide the dough into equal balls. Roll each ball into a thin circle about 4-5 inches in diameter. You can use a rolling pin or a tortilla press.</li>
        <li>Place a generous spoonful of filling in the center of the dough circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough circle in half to form a crescent shape.</li>
        <li>Seal the edges tightly using a fork or by crimping with your fingers.</li>

    <h4>Fry:</h4>
        <li>Heat enough oil in a large skillet or pot over medium heat (around 350°F).</li>
        <li>Carefully place the empanadas in batches, avoiding overcrowding the pan.</li>
        <li>Fry for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li> 

        <h4>Serve and enjoy!</h4>
        <li>Let the empanadas cool very slightly. And enjoy it with your faovorite dipping sauce like this <a href="guasacaca.html">guasacaca sauce.</a></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It is almost mandatory to enjoy a good empanada with a malta, or papelon</li>
        <li>Yes, empanadas are eaten hot. It is a convention. Don't ask, just do it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The empanadas recipe might look similar to the <a href="arepas.html">arepa's one</a>. But they're completly different vibes. </p>
