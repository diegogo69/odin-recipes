        Arepas. <em>Fritas</em>, <em>asadas</em>, <em>andinas</em>. Many tastes - many arepas.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups grams pre-cooked corn flour (masarepa)</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>250 grams cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mix the dough:</strong> In a bowl, combine warm water with salt. Gradually add the corn flour, mixing with your fingers until a soft, moist dough forms. </li>
        <li><strong>Shape the arepas:</strong> Divide the dough into equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten them into disks about 1/2 inch thick and 2-3 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the pan:</strong> Place a griddle, cast-iron pan, or non-stick pan over medium heat. Add a thin layer of oil to coat the bottom.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the arepas:</strong> Carefully place the arepas on the hot pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Oven finish (Optional):</strong>For a softer inside, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). After pan-frying the arepas, transfer them to a baking sheet and bake for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and enjoy!</strong> Your arepas are done. Now you can server them warm on their own or split open to fill with various ingredients like shredded meats, cheese, beans, or avocado.</li>
        <p>In this case we're going to eat butter and cheese filled arepas</p>
        <li>Open split the arepas carefully. Add a tablespoon of butter and a good portion of cheese of your preference</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If the dough feels dry, add a little more water by the tablespoon until it reaches a soft but manageable consistency.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands with a little water to prevent the dough from sticking while shaping the arepas.</li>
        <li>Don't overcrowd the pan when cooking. Cook the arepas in batches if necessary.</li>
        <li>Traditionally, arepas are cooked on a budare, a preheated clay griddle. But a regular pan works just fine!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In Venezuela you can see people eating arepas at any hour in the day. But if you're in the streets in the morning, you might rather go with a hot <a href="empanadas.html">empanada</a> with <a href="guasacaca.html">guasacaca</a></p>
